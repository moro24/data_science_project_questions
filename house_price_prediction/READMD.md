## Project Title: House Price Prediction 


## Description:
In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model that predicts the prices of houses based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, amenities, and other relevant factors. We will use a dataset containing historical housing data, including features and corresponding sale prices, to train and evaluate the model.

## Dataset Description
This dataset provides comprehensive information for house price prediction, with 13 column names:

- Price: The price of the house.
- Area: The total area of the house in square feet.
- Bedrooms: The number of bedrooms in the house.
- Bathrooms: The number of bathrooms in the house.
- Stories: The number of stories in the house.
- Mainroad: Whether the house is connected to the main road (Yes/No).
- Guestroom: Whether the house has a guest room (Yes/No).
- Basement: Whether the house has a basement (Yes/No).
- Hot water heating: Whether the house has a hot water heating system (Yes/No).
- Airconditioning: Whether the house has an air conditioning system (Yes/No).
- Parking: The number of parking spaces available within the house.
- Prefarea: Whether the house is located in a preferred area (Yes/No).
- Furnishing status: The furnishing status of the house (Fully Furnished, Semi-Furnished, Unfurnished).

## Goal 
Analyze the data provided and build a linear regression model to predict the price of a house and identify factors that significantly influence it.
